# Simple vertical Conky

"Simple vertical Conky" is a simple conky configuration created for the 
purpose of learning and understanding the new lua syntax in Conky 1.10 
and for those who are looking for a not-complicated monitor for their 
Linux desktops. This conky was designed under KDE Plasma 4.10 with KDE 
neon; there maybe will be some issues with the transparency of the 
window and with the fonts, in that I suggest to read the Conky 
documentation and look into the net for any problem of this kind, 
remember this is designed for learning. In all the cases, this conky 
will work fine if the package "conky-all" is installed instead 
"conky-std" and with the Poky and Liberation Sans fonts installed. The 
transparency can also be modified in the setting 
"own_window_argb_value", line 68, where 0 is completely transparent and 
255 is opaque. And as final note, the script is written in Spanish, so I 
suggest to translate the text into your language.
